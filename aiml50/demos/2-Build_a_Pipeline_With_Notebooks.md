# Build a Pipeline with Jupyter Notebooks

## Talking Points

* Show the easy connection to a workspace, data source, and compute
* Show each of the steps (you can largely ignore the python files)
* Show the code that does the pipeline registration and submitting the experiment

## Demo

* Show the Jupyter Notebook and that we can use this interactively to build these pipelines
  * Walk through the steps in the already run through `seer_pipeline.ipynb` notebook
* Show that we’re building a workflow with
  * data prep,
  * training,
  * and registration steps
* Show that we’re creating and submitting this pipeline in AML services
  * Follow the link to the Azure Portal and details of the run.

## Example Demo
